## ALX Software engineering
The simple shell is a ALX project in the first trimester, helps student to understand the advanced
concepts behind the shell program include process, system call, bit manipulation, file managment, error handling ...
#General
* who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
* Who is Ken Thompson
* How does a shell work
* What is a pid and a ppid
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What is the difference between a function and a system call
* How to create processes
* What are the three prototypes of main
* How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
* How to execute another program with the execve system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
* What is EOF / “end-of-file”?
##Requirements
#General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks
* No more than 5 functions per file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
## Features
* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
* If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors.
* Hndling the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
* Hanling the command line with arguments
* Handle the PATH
* Support the exit features and the exit status
* Handle the Ctrl-C to not terminate the shell
* Handling the command seperator `;`
* Handling `&&` and `||` logical operators
* Handle variable replacements `$?` and `$$`
* Handle the comments `#`
* Support the history feature
* Support the file input
## Builtins
* The exit builtin `exit [STATUS]`
* The change directory `cd [DIRECTORY] | [OPTION]`
* Display the environnment variables `env`
* Initialize a new environnment variables or created if not match `setenv [VARIABLE] [VALUE]`
* Remove an environnment variable `unsetenv [VARIABLE]`
* Support the aliases `alias [name [='value'] ...]`
* Display help `help [BUILTIN]`
* Display history `history`
